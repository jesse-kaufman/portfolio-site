# Portfolio website

This repository holds the files used to generate my [portfolio site](https://www.jessekaufman.com) which is powered by [Hugo CMS](https://www.gohugo.io). Github actions deploy changes to the live site when commits are pushed to Github.

I'm also building an API in Node.js/Express.js that will power a future contact form on my website.
