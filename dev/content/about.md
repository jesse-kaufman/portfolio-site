title: 'About Jesse Kaufman'
---
I am a passionate and versatile software developer with over 25 years of experience in web development, primarily focusing on PHP, JavaScript, and Node.js. Over the years, I have transitioned to modern development practices, exploring technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Docker. This shift is driven by my keen interest in event-driven programming and working with NoSQL databases, while also embracing DevOps principles, including CI/CD workflows, containerization, automation, and test-driven development.

With a strong foundation in PHP, I have extensive experience working with legacy codebases, particularly in content management systems like WordPress and WooCommerce. However, over time, I have grown more passionate about working with Node.js, enjoying the flexibility and scalability it offers for backend development. My experience spans across creating APIs, working with databases, and integrating AI systems into projects.

My development interests also extend into infrastructure management—particularly with Docker—where I actively manage containerized environments and streamline workflows for both local and production environments. Through a hands-on approach to both development and system administration, I continuously seek to enhance my workflow and efficiency—balancing code with operations for a smooth DevOps experience.

I thrive in environments where problem-solving and hands-on experimentation are encouraged. I'm always eager to apply new technologies and tools to real-world projects.
